# KEY RELATIONSHIPS

CROSS-DOMAIN LINKS
* `design.md` (art/text) ↔ `site.md` (sw/design/app) ↔ `frontend.md` (sw/design/app)
* `stat.md` (stem/math) ↔ `analytics.md` (sw/design/data)
* `philosophy.md` ↔ bookcase fiction notes

COMMON PATTERNS
* `🗄️ sociology.md` print culture - referenced from bookcase
* `🗄️ aesthetics.md` canon - referenced from bookcase reviews
* music theory ↔ piano/guitar practice notes

# USE CASES

When working with domains:
* learning new topic (find existing notes, add to 进步)
* cross-referencing software work with domain knowledge
* building reading lists
* site redesign: pull from `design.md`, `writing.md`
