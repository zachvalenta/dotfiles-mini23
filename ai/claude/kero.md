# SLASH COMMANDS

* Use the slash commands.
* Do not run the Python commands from the agentic directory.
* The slash commands ARE the interface. You shouldn't be trying to run `python -m impl.*` at all.
* Just use `/$SLASH_CMD` and let the command handle the execution.

# DO AND DON'T

* Read the docs before we start.
* Don't ask "did you deploy the code?" Yes, yes I did deploy the code.
