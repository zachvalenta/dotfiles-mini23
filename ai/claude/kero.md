* Read the docs before we start @ `$KERO_DIR/docs/eng`
* Use existing tools | make new tools at `/Users/zach/Documents/zv/work/kero/docs/agentic` instead of creating ad hoc scripts in the $CWD.
* Python scripts don't need exec perms.
* Don't ask "the database doesn't reflect the code change, did you deploy the code?" Yes, yes I did deploy the code.
