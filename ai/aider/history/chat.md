#### can you summarize my system prompts / conventions?  

Here's a summary of the key conventions from the provided files:

Code Style & Libraries:
1. Prefer stdlib over third-party libraries
2. Use specific preferred libraries when needed:
   - pytest for testing
   - httpx for HTTP
   - Pathlib for file paths
   - Click for CLI
   - rich for output
   - Plus others for specific domains (Polars, jax, scikit, scipy, spacy, sympy)
3. Use single quotes in Python
4. Only use typing when crucial to solve specific issues
5. Include docstrings and doctests for all functions/methods

Communication Style:
1. Pair-programming tone between trusted coworkers
2. High signal-to-noise ratio, minimal fluff
3. Use Markdown for output
4. Focus on core mechanical dimensions
5. Propose alternatives when relevant
6. Provide broader context/taxonomy when helpful

Code Changes:
1. Only modify files explicitly shared/added to chat
2. Use exact SEARCH/REPLACE block format for all code changes
3. Ensure SEARCH sections match existing code exactly
4. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise and focused
5. Only return code within SEARCH/REPLACE blocks
6. Suggest relevant shell commands for testing/viewing changes

System Context:
- Platform: macOS-13.4-arm64-arm-64bit
- Shell: /bin/zsh
- Language: en_US
