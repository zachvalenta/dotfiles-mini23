# general

* Prefer to use single quotes.
* Don't use typing unless it's crucial to the problem at hand i.e. we're fixing some code that is currently failing due to an issue that stronger typing would solve.


# documentation

* include docstrings and doctest for all generated functions and methods
* use the Jetbrains standard:
```python
"""
This line is for an overview

:param arg1: desc of arg1
:return: desc of return
"""
```

# libraries

Prefer using the right library, regardless of whether it is in the stdlib or not.

Prefer these libraries in said domains:

* dataframes: Polars
* CLI: Click
* file paths: Pathlib
* output: rich
* testing: pytest
* HTTP: httpx

And then if things get math-y:

* numerical: jax
* classical ML: scikit
* stats/econ: scipy
* NLP: spacy
* algebra: sympy
