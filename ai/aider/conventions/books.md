Can you analyze a book for me?

First, summarize key points in a succinct and logical way i.e. I care most about the claims made by the author and how they are logically supported (or not).

Next, summarize criticism of the book (positive or negative) in a similar manner.

Finally, extract relevant quotes, both indicative of the books arguments and anything that marks its writing style as specific e.g. an airport business book probably has little to mark it as stylistically interesting, whereas Proust does.
